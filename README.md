## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Jonah - a chronic tinkerer, career switching into software development.  

You might find me cycling up and down the Scottish coast with a surfboard, listening to an audiobook whilst reading a paper on long covid and doing a handstand... 


ðŸŒ± **Learning**: Front-end: Working my way through The Odin Project to consolidate my understanding of front end webdev.

ðŸ”­ **Working on** : Building out an Events Planning app using Spring Boot and Flutter.

ðŸš€ **Moving towards**: Finding a junior role that in some perfect world sits at the confluence of my interests.
