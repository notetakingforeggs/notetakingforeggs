## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Jonah, a chronic tinkerer, career switching into software development.
You might find me cycling up and down the Scottish coast with a surfboard, listening to an audiobook whilst reading a paper on long covid and doing a handstand... if i ever learn to do these things at the same time.
